# Java-Reverse_Each_Word_In_String
This Java program reverses each word in a string while keeping their positions. It takes user input, splits it into words, reverses them using a helper method, and stores them in an array. The words are then joined back into a string and displayed. The reverse method iterates through each word in reverse order to construct the result.
